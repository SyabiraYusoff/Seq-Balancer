# Seq-Balancer: BD Rhapsody™ Dual Index Check (NovaSeqX Leap Chemistry)

[Access the web tool here](https://syabirayusoff.github.io/Seq-Balancer/)

This tool helps you check and balance dual indexing primers for BD Rhapsody™ kits, specifically for use with **NovaSeqX Leap chemistry**. It ensures optimal colour balance and compatibility of selected i5 and i7 primers, reducing the risk of sequencing failures due to unbalanced or incompatible index combinations.

## Features
- Supports both BD OMICS-One Dual Index Kit and BD OMICS-One Dual Index XT Kit.
- Visualise and analyse colour balance for selected primer combinations.
- Highlights compatible primers based on curated compatibility maps for each kit.
- Designed for use with NovaSeqX Leap chemistry workflows.

## How to Use
1. **Select Your Indexing Kit**
   - Choose either the standard or XT kit using the tabs at the top.
2. **Select Primers**
   - In each table (i5 and i7), select one or more primers by checking the boxes.
   - The tool will highlight compatible primers and show colour balance analysis for your selection.
3. **Review colour Balance**
   - The analysis table below shows the colour balance at each base position for your selected primers.
   - Warnings will appear if any position has "No signal" or is unbalanced.
4. **Repeat for Each Lane**
   - Repeat the process for every lane/sample you plan to run on the NovaSeqX sequencer.

## Notes
- This tool is specifically designed for **NovaSeqX Leap chemistry** workflows.
- Always use the correct compatibility indexes for your kit.
- For best results, select more than one primer to ensure robust colour balance.
